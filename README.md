### Description

Have a SprintPCS or Centennial cell phone that supports notifications? If you do, you are going to love this source. Both projects come with an easy-to-use user control designed by me. A user-friendly interface, as well as a help file, makes this program very easy to use. Track a SprintPCS message with the tracking feature. Modify/customize the source to fit your needs in any way. All I ask is that you give me credit for the PCS and Centennial user control made by me if you use them in any of your projects.
